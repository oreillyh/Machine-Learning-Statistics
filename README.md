# Machine-Learning-Statistics
Machine Learning &amp; Statistics Module, GMIT H.Dip Data Analytics

Module project for the Machine Learning and Statistics Module for the H. Dip. Data Analytics in GMIT 2019

By Hugh O'Reilly

This repository contains 2 files: This Readme.md file which provides an overview of the project and how the code contained within it should be ran and a jupyter notebook: Machine Learning and Statistics Project whcih contains the analysis of the Boston House Prices Dataset.


# How to run this Jupyter Notebook

This project is ran using 'Jupyter': https://jupyter.org/ as a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are included in the 'Anaconda' package https://www.anaconda.com/ 

To save and run the file, 'right-click' on the file and save to your local directory as a '.ipynb' file. Then, using the CMD line, navigate to the directory containing the file and type 'jupyter notebook'. This will open the Jupyter notebook environment from which this notebook may be opened.

# Project Plan


## Boston House Prices Dataset

The Boston house prices dataset is the subject of this project

## Import and Clean Data

The dataset is first imported and an initial exploration carried out in order to gain initial insights. The dataset is then sorted to enable descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to be carried out.

**Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis is carried out using the Matplotlib, scipi, statsmodels and seaborn python libraries**

**Predictive analysis of the dataset is then carried out using the Keras python deep learning library.**


## 1) Descriptive Statistics
  Statistical Summary of Dataset

## 2) Inferential Statistics
  Difference in Price of Houses along Charles River
  t-test
  ANOVA
  
## 3) Predictive Analytics
  KERAS Neural Network
